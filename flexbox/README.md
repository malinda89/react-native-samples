# React-Native Flexbox Sample
Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3, which is also usable in react native just like in web but with a few exceptions.
The defaults are different, with `flexDirection` defaulting to `column` instead of `row`, and the `flex` parameter only supporting a single number.

This app simply demonstrates the use of flex items within a container with some commonly used attributes such as:
* flexDirection
* justifyContent
* alignItems
