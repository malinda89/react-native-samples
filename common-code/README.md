# React native app that makes use of common code.

This app demonstrates how to write common code that reflects both `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js` so that code does not need to be duplicated in both the classes (which are the entry points of the app).

## Build Steps

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Running On Android

* `react-native run-android`

## Running On IOS

* `react-native run-ios`
