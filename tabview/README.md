# React-Native Tab View (iOS only)

This app demos how to use the tabs component on iOS devices. As of now, there is no support for Android, and if we really want to use tabs, we would have to use a third-party library to add similar functionality.

## Build Steps

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Running On Android

* `react-native run-android`

## Running On IOS

* `react-native run-ios`
